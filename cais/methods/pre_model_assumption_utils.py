"""
Pre-modeling assumption checks for causal inference methods.

These checks are run before estimation to verify whether the data and study
design satisfy the assumptions required by the chosen causal method.
Statistical checks use the raw data directly. Non-testable assumptions
are assessed via LLM reasoning based on the dataset description.

Each check returns an AssumptionResult with:
    passed   : bool | None  (None => inconclusive)
    reasoning: str
    details  : dict         (raw stats — F, p, SMDs, ...)
