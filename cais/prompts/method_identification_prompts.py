IV_IDENTIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert in causal inference. 
You need to assess whether a valid instrument exists in the dataset to apply Instrumental Variable (IV) methods for estimating causal effects to answer the user query.
Use systematic reasoning to evaluate potential instruments against strict criteria. You need to be strict with the assessment.
Do not suggest IV based on weak reasoning. 

User Query: "{query}"
Dataset Description: {description}
Treatment: {treatment}
Outcome: {outcome}
Available Columns: {column_info}

Think through this step by step:

Step 1: Understand the causal question
- What causal effect is the user trying to estimate?
- What potential unobserved confounders might affect treatment and outcome?

Step 2: Identify potential instrumental variables
- Which columns could plausibly serve as instruments?
- Exclude the treatment and outcome variables themselves
- Look for variables that might influence treatment assignment and do not directly affect the outcome
- Only consider variables that exist in the available columns list

Step 3: Evaluate each potential IV against the four key conditions

Condition 1 - Relevance:
- Does this variable directly influence the treatment?

Condition 2 - Exclusion restriction:
- Does this variable affect the outcome only through the treatment? There should be no direct pathway from instrument to outcome bypassing treatment. 

Condition 3 - Independence:
- Is this variable as good as randomly assigned with respect to unobserved confounders? This means 
    it should not be correlated with any factors that affect the outcome other than through treatment.

Those are general IV assumptions. However, we also see if this is an encouragement design or encouragement-like setting.
Condition 4 - Compliance:
- Is there compliance variation, i.e., some units who weren't eligible to get the treatment got treatment or vice versa?
- Do we have data showing some units didn't follow their assigned treatment? If there is no data on compliance, discard this condition.

Step 4: Make final determination
- Select the best candidate only if it satisfies all conditions
- If no good candidates exist, return null
- Only select variables from the available columns; do not create new variables

RDD_IDENTIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert in causal inference. 
You need to identify if a running variable exists for performing Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to answer the user query. 
Go through the data description and available columns carefully. You need to be strict with the assessment.
In RDD, treatment assignment (for analysis) is determined by whether a continuous variable crosses a specific threshold.
Whether the treatment is assigned above or below the cutoff can be determined by the user query or dataset description.

User Query: "{query}"
Dataset Description: {description}
Outcome: {outcome}
Available Columns: {column_info}

Think through this step by step:

Step 1: Analyze the research design
- Does the query or description imply a cutoff, threshold, or eligibility criterion?
- Check if the design implies that a cutoff/threshold determines if the unit receives the intervention or not.

Step 2: If there is a running variable implied by the context, identify the running variable:
- What is the variable associated with the cutoff, i.e., what variable determines whether a unit is receiving the intervention/treatment or not?

Step 3: Identify the cutoff value from design
- What specific threshold value determines treatment assignment?

Step 4: Identify if the treatment is assigned above or below the cutoff
- Is the treatment assigned above the cutoff? Store it as a boolean value in 'treat_above_cutoff' in the JSON.
- Store null if you are unsure.

Step 5: Final determination
- Only suggest RDD if both running variable and cutoff value can be identified
- Return null if the assignment mechanism is not threshold-based or you are unsure.

Think through this step by step:

Step 1: Look for randomization indicators

Step 2: Assess assignment method
- Was treatment assigned randomly?

Step 3: Make determination
- True if random assignment is clearly indicated

Step 1: Distinguish between subgroup analysis and overall effects
- Is the query asking for differential effects across groups (interaction needed)?
- Or is it asking for overall average effects (no interaction needed)?

Step 2: Analyze the query and see if it implies subgroup effects
- Does the query explicitly ask about treatment effects for specific subgroups?

Step 3: Identify the relevant interaction covariate
- Which covariate from the available list would define the subgroups mentioned?
- Only select variables that exist in the available covariates list

- Only suggest interaction if subgroup comparison is explicitly mentioned
- Default to no interaction if unclear or asking for overall effects

- What is the specific treatment whose causal effect needs to be estimated, i.e., what is the intervention of interest?

Step 2: Distinguish between assignment and actual treatment
- For experimental data: Is this an encouragement design where assignment differs from actual uptake?
- Look for variables representing what units actually received vs what they were assigned

Fields to extract:

1. mediator_variable
   A column that plausibly carries the treatment's effect to the outcome
   (a causal pathway T -> M -> Y). It must be an available column and must
   not be the treatment or the outcome itself. Only report it if the query
   or description describes such a mechanism. Return null otherwise.
   Example: "ad exposure" mediating the effect of a marketing campaign on sales.

2. treatment_period_start
   When the treatment/policy begins, in the same units as the time column
   (e.g. a year like 1988). Only if stated or clearly implied by the text.

3. placebo_period_start
   The start of a pre-treatment period during which the outcome should not
   yet respond to the treatment (an anticipation-free placebo window).
   Only if the text states or clearly implies one.

4. is_encouragement_design
   true ONLY if units were randomized into an encouragement or nudge, while
   the actual treatment uptake was left to the units (encouragement differs
